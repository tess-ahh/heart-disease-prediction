#Heart Disease prediction
This repository contains my Heart Disease Prediction project built using Python and machine learning techniques.
Unlike my first repository, which was an introductory profile, this is my first complete, end-to-end project involving real data, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation. 
The project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset and implements a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical features. 
The workflow includes data cleaning, label encoding of categorical variables, handling missing values, train–test splitting, model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, along with feature importance visualization. 
The project was initially developed in Google Colab for experimentation and learning, and later migrated to VS Code for better structure and local development.
The original Colab code is retained as commented sections for reference and transparency.
